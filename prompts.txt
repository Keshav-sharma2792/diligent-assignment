Prompt 1:
Generate synthetic e-commerce data for a sample retail system. Create five CSV files with realistic values and relationships between columns:

1. customers.csv → customer_id, full_name, email, city, created_at  
2. products.csv → product_id, product_name, category, price  
3. orders.csv → order_id, customer_id, order_date, order_status  
4. order_items.csv → item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity  
5. payments.csv → payment_id, order_id, payment_amount, payment_mode, payment_date

Generate approximately 100 rows for each file. Ensure foreign keys (customer_id, product_id, order_id) match logically. Save all files inside a folder named /data.
Prompt 2:
Write Python code to ingest the synthetic e-commerce CSV files into a SQLite database. The code should:

1. Create a database named "ecommerce.db".
2. Create tables for customers, products, orders, order_items, and payments
   with appropriate data types and primary/foreign keys.
3. Read the CSV files from the /data folder.
4. Insert the records into the respective tables.
5. Include basic error handling and print a confirmation message after a successful import.

The output should be a complete and ready-to-run Python script.
Prompt 3:
Write an SQL query that joins the customers, orders, order_items, payments, and products tables to generate a consolidated report containing:

- customer_name  
- order_id  
- product_name  
- quantity  
- price  
- total_amount (computed as quantity * price)

Ensure the query uses proper JOINs, handles relationships correctly, and sorts the output by customer_name and order_id.
